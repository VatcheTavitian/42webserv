Uploading of files must be done with base64 encoding.
There must be a valid upload directory present.
This is because we found when uploading large files and simply extracting the content within the HTTP request 'boundary' was not
sufficient to ensure the integrity of the data.
As such, as per JS uploader.js file, the file content is encoded and base64 before sending the request to the webserver.
The server then receives and decodes the content in the handleUpload() function.
Please see upload.html and uploader.js files.

During testing we found that uploading large files can stall the server, and behave in a 'blocking' affect.
This is because the server utilises base64 decoding function which can consume resources.
As such, if the payload size is found to be greater than 10000 bytes, a separate thread is launched to minimise 
the stalling affect large files have during upload.
Consult handleUpload() and handleUploadWithThread() functions in Request.cpp
